# BehaviourGuard
This project is a **Behavior-Based Malware Classification System**. It's an automated platform that analyzes malicious software by combining **static and dynamic analysis**. It uses **Flask** and **Celery** to stay responsive, leverages **Hybrid Analysis** for safe execution, and generates **YARA rules** and **IOCs** in a final **PDF report**.
